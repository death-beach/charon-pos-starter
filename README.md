# Charon POS Starter (Solana Pay + POS flow)

Accept USDC via Solana Pay from a POS order and mark it PAID on confirmation. Minimal, framework-agnostic starter to show the flow we use with Clover.

## Highlights
- Generate Solana Pay URLs + QR codes for a given orderId/amount
- Confirm on-chain settlement and update order status
- 60â€“90s demo video: <Loom link>
- Works with any POS that exposes createOrder/updateOrder APIs (Clover shown in demo)

## How it works
1. POS creates an order and POSTs to /payments to request crypto checkout
2. Server returns a Solana Pay URL; client renders QR
3. Customer scans with a wallet (e.g., Phantom) and pays in USDC
4. Server listens for confirmation and updates the order to PAID
